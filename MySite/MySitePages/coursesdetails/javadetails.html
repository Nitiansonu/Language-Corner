						Java is a general-purpose computer programming language
						that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and
						specifically designed to have as few implementation
						dependencies as possible. It is intended to let 
						application developers "write once, run anywhere",
						meaning that compiled java code can run on all
						platforms that supports java without the need for
						recompilation.Sun Microsystem released the first public 
						implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised "Write
						Once, Run Anywhere", providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly
						secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed
						network and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers
						soon incorporated the ability to run java applets within 
						web pages, and java quickly became popular, while mostly
						outside of browsers, that wasn't the original plan.<br>

					<p class="msg" id="p2">
						According to Sun, 3 billion devices run java. There are many
						devics where java is currently used. Some of them are desktop
						application such as acrobat reader, media
