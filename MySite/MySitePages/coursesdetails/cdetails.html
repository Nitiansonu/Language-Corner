If you find that the executable program resulting from a C program is not efficient, it's probably because of something silly you did, not because of something the compiler did behind your back which you have no control over.

						C is a relatively small language, but one which
						wears well. C's small, unambitious feature set is a
						real advantage: there's less to learn; there isn't
						excess baggage in the way when you don't need it.
						It can also be disadvantage: since it doesn't do
						everything for you, there's a lot you have to do
						yourself. (Actually, this is viewed by many as an
						additional advantage: anything the language doesn't
						do for you, it doesn't dictate to you, either, so you're
						free to do that something however you want.)<br>

						C is sometimes reffered to as a "high-level assembly
						language." Some people think that's an insult, but it's
						actually a deliberate and significant aspect of the
						language. If you have programmed in assembly language,
						you'll probably find C very natural and comfortable
						(although if you continue to focus too heavily on machine
						-level details, you'll probably end up with unnecessarily
						nonportable programs). If you haven't programmed in assembly
						language, you may be frustrated expensive by C's lack of 
						certain higher-level features. In either case, you should
						understand why C was developed
