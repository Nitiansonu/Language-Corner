						C++(pronounced cee plus plus) is a general-purpose
						programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented
						and generic programming features, while also providing
						facilities for low-level memory manipulation.<br>
					</p>
					<p class="msg" id="p2">
						It was designed with a bias toward system programming and
						embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with
						performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its
						design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in
						many other contexts, with key strengths being software
						infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,
						including desktop application, servers (e.g. e-comerce,
						web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical 
						applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
						C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it
						available on many platforms and provided by various
						organizations, including the Free Software Foundation
						(FSF's GCC), LLVM, Microsoft, Intel and IBM.<br>
